## 3-TRAIN_FFNN_STEP
[All the scripts available are self-explanatory, explaining what it does in the header and some comments through the code]

In this step, I develop the FFNN with NNAIMGUI and MM2SF for the prediction of the Localization Index (LI) creating the database using QTAIM through the AIMQB package in a set of 18 aminoacids with different geometries generated by MD

To develop the FFNN and its respective database the purposed methodology is:

## Select the method to generate the geometries ("0-test-alanine")
To create geometries as input for the model two options will be considered: Normal Mode Sampling (NMS) and Molecular Dynamics (MD). In this step, in my case, I took the alanine molecule to compare the results obtained with both methods.
All this step was used to justify why I chose MD as the more effective method to generate geometries.

## Run the MD ("1-MD")
For each amino-acid I run a MD at GFN1-xTB theory level with Langevin dynamics.
[With "run_md.py" script the MD with ASE code will be performed for a given xyz file]
[With "traj2xyz.py" script the traj file output will be transformed into a xyz file]
[With "xyz_splitter_jumping.py" a xyz file with multiple geometries will be splitted in xyz files every some frames]
[With "md_simulation.sh" script "run_md.py","traj2xyz.py" and "xyz_splitter_jumping.py" codes are executed in this directory]
[With "1-multi_MD.sh" script the "md_simulation.sh" will be performed for each amino-acid grouping the results in a directory]

## Calculate its LIs at QTAIM level of theory ("2-Gaussian-SP" + "3-aimqb")
From the selected geometries I run a SP (single-point) calculation with Gaussian generating a 'wfn' file for each one.After, using this 'wfn' files as input, a QTAIM calculation were performed with AIMQB package, obtaining the QTAIM properties for each atom in each geometry.
[With "1-all_traj2inp_traj.py" script from all the files in "all_trajectories" '10*natom' geometries are chosen randomly and saved in different xyz files]
[With "2-xyz2gaussian.sh" script for each xyz file generated before it creates a gaussian input to perform the SP calculation]
[With "aimqb.sh" script from the 'wfn' files generated with Gaussian it run the AIMQB calculation for all of them]

## Build the ACSFs to describe the chemical space ("4-ACSFs")
In my case, first I used the same xyz files as in the previous step ("same_db_as_training") but checking the results, a poor description of the trios NNN and OOO was founded. 
By this I decided to boost this trios adding more geometries with this trios in is atomic structure ("db_boost_trios").
[With "radial.py" and "angular.py" the two and three body components respectively will be calculated with MM2SF code which applies GMM for and optimal unsupervised selection of parameters]
[With "1-all_traj2buffed_traj.py" the dataset boosting the NNN and OOO trios will be created]

## Train the FFNN model with the ACSFs and the AIMQB results ("5-trainer")
Not jet !

Additionally, the obtained result will be used to perform a "re-validation" step to NNAIMQ, thi time with more data. All this new validation results will be found in the directory "X-validation_step"
Not jet !
