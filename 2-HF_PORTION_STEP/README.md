# 2-HF_PORTION_STEP
In this step, I modify the HF contribution in the B3LYP functional to study the relation between the percentage used and the error committed in the prediction of QTAIM properties.

The obtained results are:

- aimqb-results: obtained in the same way as in the "VALIDATION_STEP"
- hf-RESULTS: not jet!
