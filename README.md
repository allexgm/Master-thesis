## 1-VALIDATION_STEP
In this step, the NNAIMGUI code with the default FFNN inplemented to predict the partial charges (NNAIMQ) of each atom from a xyz given file is appied to a selected group of molecules in order to comprobe the aplicability of this method. To do this, the predicted results was compared with the obtained with the QTAIM-based AIMQB program.

## 2-HF_PORTION_STEP
In this step, I modify the HF contribution in the B3LYP functional to study the relation between the percentage used and the error committed in the prediction of QTAIM properties.

## 3-TRAIN_FFNN_STEP
In this step, I develop the FFNN with NNAIMGUI and MM2SF for the prediction of the Localization Index (LI) creating the database using QTAIM through the AIMQB package in a set of 18 aminoacids with different geometries generated by MD
